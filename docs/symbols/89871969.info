[[[description]]]
The `ZEND_NOP` opcode is used for when no instruction needs to be executed. This is typically used when multiple opcodes have been compacted through optimisation, effectively leaving the behind `ZEND_NOP`s in place of the old instructions (which can be later removed in the block pass stage).

This can be sees in the [Opcache](https://github.com/php/php-src/tree/master/ext/opcache) extension. For example, when the result of a post increment operation is not used, [it is optimised to a pre incrementation operation](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/a94fc577af6bfef3a623cded5aecc2dbb9710e85/ext/opcache/Optimizer/pass3.c#L409). This is because pre incrementation requires only one opcode ([`ZEND_PRE_INC`]()LINK HERE), as opposed to the two opcodes ([`ZEND_POST_INC`]()LINK HERE and [`ZEND_FREE`]()LINK HERE) required by post incrementation. So the `ZEND_POST_INC` opcode is converted to the `ZEND_PRE_INC` opcode, and the `ZEND_FREE`opcode is converted into a `ZEND_NOP` opcode.
