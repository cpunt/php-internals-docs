[[[description]]]
This flag is used for both Zend Functions and [Zend Classes](https://phpinternals.net/categories/zend_classes), where it marks a function or class as being final. This is used to prevent violations of this constraint at both compile-time (such as class definitions) and runtime (such as anonymous class definitions).

[[[additional_information]]]
For example, we can set this flag on a class entry during class registration by:
```c
PHP_MINIT_FUNCTION(ext_name)
{
    zend_class_entry ce;

    INIT_CLASS_ENTRY(ce, "NewClass", NewClass_methods);

    NewClass_ce = zend_register_internal_class(&ce);

    NewClass_ce->ce_flags |= ZEND_ACC_FINAL; // line of interest
}
```
