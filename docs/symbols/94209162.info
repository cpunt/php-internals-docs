[[[description]]]
This flag denotes a fully initialised [`HashTable`](https://phpinternals.net/docs/hashtable) (including having allocated its buckets). It is used to ensure that a hash table is initialised before use, as well as to prevent accidental double initialisation of a hash table (which would cause memory to leak and lost data).

[[[additional_information]]]
For example:
```c
zend_bool is_init(HashTable *ht)
{
    return !!(ht->u.flags & HASH_FLAG_INITIALIZED);
}
```
