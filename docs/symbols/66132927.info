[[[description]]]
This [Zend Class](https://phpinternals.net/categories/zend_classes) fetching flag is used to specify whether an exception should be thrown or an `E_ERROR` (the default) should be emitted in the event that an unrecognised class name has been encountered. It is more common to see exceptions being thrown in such cases, with an `E_ERROR` being emitted in places such as a class declaration (e.g. extending a non-existent class).
