[[[description]]]
This [garbage collector](https://phpinternals.net/categories/garbage_collector) flag is used specifically for strings to denote an interned string.

Interned strings are created for commonly used strings. They are not garbage collected, and so they avoid the overhead of reference counting and being collected once they have been finished with. Interned strings are, therefore, a tradeoff of slightly increasing memory usage in exchange for an increase in performance.

A string can be checked to see if it is interned with the [`ZSTR_IS_INTERNED`](https://phpinternals.net/docs/zstr_is_interned) macro.
