[[[description]]]
This flag is set when a [`HashTable`](https://phpinternals.net/docs/hashtable) needs its element count to be recalculated. One hash table where this always needs to be performed is the executor globals symbol table (for the `$GLOBALS` PHP array). This is because this hash table holds elements of type [`IS_INDIRECT`](https://phpinternals.net/docs/is_indirect), which means the values they point to could be unset (see [`IS_UNDEF`](https://phpinternals.net/docs/is_undef)). The only way to get the true element count of such a hash table is to iterate through all of its elements and check specifically for this condition.
