[[[description]]]
This type is used specifically for the `counted` member of a [`zend_value`](https://phpinternals.net/docs/zend_value) - a member that provides generic access to the value of any reference-counted type (see [`IS_TYPE_REFCOUNTED`](https://phpinternals.net/docs/is_type_refcounted)). This is done by keeping the `gc` field as its first member, so that the memory layout of this type overlaps with the standard memory layout of the refcounted types (which all have `gc` as their first member, e.g. [`zend_string`](https://phpinternals.net/docs/zend_string), [`zend_object`](https://phpinternals.net/docs/zend_object), [`zend_array`](https://phpinternals.net/docs/zend_array), etc). This allows for reference-counted types to be handled generically (such as when [destroying a value](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/8e1209160020d55f9cfdf2e7fa6000b5b402ba73/Zend/zend_variables.c#L31)), without having to specifically know what type they are.
