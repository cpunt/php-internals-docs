PHP extensions are by far the most common type of extension. They are most commonly used for exposing a C library to use from PHP (such as [ext/sodium](https://github.com/php/php-src/tree/21cd57e5f2d286ab77ab44a05d2d16c16e4f15e6/ext/sodium)) and integrating into other technologies (such as [ext/mysqlnd](https://github.com/php/php-src/tree/master/ext/mysqlnd)).

Developing a PHP extension is made quite easy with the extension generation script found at `ext/ext_skel.php` (prior to PHP 7.2, this was a bash file). Simply executing this script with an extension name (via `--ext=NAME` - avoid hyphenating the name since it is used for symbol names in the generated C) will produce a basic, barebones extension.
